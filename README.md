# Search Algorithm Analysis

This is a command line tool for comparing the effectiveness of multiple search algorithms across varying types of graph geometries.

The tool can analyse a breadth first search, dijkstra's algorithm, and the A* algorithm.

The tool compares the relative performance across different types of weighted undirected graphs.

The first are graphs with completely random edge weights

The second are graphs whose vertices represent points on a 2d plane, with edge weights corresponding to their euclidean distance.

The third are graphs sourced from real world road networks.
